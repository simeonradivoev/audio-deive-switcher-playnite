# Audio Device Switcher
A plugin for Playnite that allows you to switch your Windows active sound device.
I made this so I can easily change my audio with my controller when in fullscreen.

## Features
* Change active audio device on demand from the Desktop and Fullscreen apps
* Change the default audio device when you enter the Fullscreen app and restore it when you exit.
